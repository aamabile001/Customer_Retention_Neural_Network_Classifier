# Customer_Retention_Neural_Network_Classifier
Many banks face the challenge of 'churn,' that is, customers leaving and joining another bank. As such, it is important to understand what is important to customers as well any factors that may lead a customer to decide to leave for another bank. With this information, banks can better focus their effort and resources that are most important to customers so that fewer customers leave. 

This project undertakes the opportunity to:  

- Build a neural network-based classifer that can determine whether a customer will leave or not in the next 6 months.
